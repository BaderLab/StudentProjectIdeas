# Students interested in interning in the Baderlab

Undergraduate students seeking a Computational Biology/Bioinformatics research position in the [Bader Lab](baderlab.org).  **Computer programming ability and a strong interest in biology is required.**

There are two main rounds of applications for internships in the Bader lab.  Students looking for summer interships should apply in March.  Students looking for year long placements for courses such as [BCB330](https://bcb.csb.utoronto.ca/bcb330y-project/) or [BCB430](https://bcb.csb.utoronto.ca/bcb430y-project/) should apply in July.  For students looking to do the year long course it is recommended that you do a summer internship in the lab prior to starting the course (This is not a requirement just a recommendation).

Bader lab members can join the baderlab-applications mailing list to access student project applications.

Google maintains and excellent student project mentorship guide that all student mentors should review at https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/resources/guide  There is also a student guide that has useful tips.  We just need to ignore all the Google Summer of Code-specific administration detais from this guide.
